# MAVLink-Data-Loader
MAVLink is a serial protocol most commonly used to send data and commands between vehicles and ground stations.

This repository is handy for reviewing data from flight missions, especially at the mission's end where '.bin' files hold various structured data. However, these files can be tough to handle. To make it easier, you can use the 'Mission Planner' application (on Windows) to convert '.bin' files to '.mat' files. These '.mat' files can then be effortlessly loaded into MATLAB for data analysis.

This repository's main goal is to help you bring MAVLink data into Python smoothly.
